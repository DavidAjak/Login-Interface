Login Application
Overview
This application is designed to validate user login credentials. It ensures that the input fields meet the necessary requirements before allowing access. The application demonstrates validation using three different programming paradigms: Functional, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Procedural Programming.

Features
Input Validation:
Ensures that the fields are not empty on submission.
Validates that the username field is a valid email address.
Ensures the password is more than 8 characters long.
Validation Paradigms
Functional Programming:
Utilizes functions to handle validation without maintaining state.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Encapsulates validation logic within classes and objects.
Procedural Programming:
Implements validation through a sequence of instructions.

Usage
Functional Validation:

Calls the function-based validation logic to validate the input fields.
OOP Validation:

Uses objects and classes to handle the validation process.
Procedural Validation:

Follows a procedural approach to validate the input fields step by step.

Code Structure
main.cpp: The main entry point of the application.
functional_validation.cpp: Contains the functions for functional validation.
oop_validation.cpp: Contains the classes and methods for OOP validation.
procedural_validation.cpp: Contains the procedural logic for validation.
